A-Life Kritikal Protector
REASONS YOU NEED A CRITICAL ILLNESS PLAN
Full recovery from critical illness can be a long and taxing journey, which can take a toll on you, physically, mentally and financially.
Sure, a medical plan can cover the treatment costs when you are hospitalised, but here are the costs we often overlook when it comes to critical illness diagnosis:

Seeking Alternative treatments
Hiring a Caregiver
Paying for your financial commitments
Keeping your financial plans and goals
