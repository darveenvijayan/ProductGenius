section:A-Plus Saver
question:Under what circumstances will A-Plus Saver be attached to A-Life Wealth Premier and why?
answer:why? In order to comply with the Minimum Sum Assured Multiple (SAM) rule required by Bank Negara Malaysia, if the annual premium for A-Life Wealth Premier exceeds the maximum Protection premium allowed under the Bank Negara Malaysia requirement, the excess premium will be allocated into A-Plus Saver. The Minimum Sum Assured Multiple (SAM) for age 18 to 25 years old is 55; 26 to 35 years old is 50; 36 to 45 years old is 35; 46 to 55 years old is 25; while for 56 and above is 15. 
For example: A male non-smoker aged 40, purchasing a A-Life Wealth Premier policy with sum assured of RM2,000,000 and covers up to age 80. Maximum regular Protection premium allowable under the BNM guidelines is RM2,000,000/35 = RM57,143 If he chooses to pay premium throughout the coverage term, the annual premium is RM21,360 which is less than the maximum Protection premium allowable under regulatory requirement and all the premiums will be allocated into Protection Account and A-Plus Saver is unnecessary. However, he still can choose to put some A-Plus Saver premium to increase his account value, depending on his own preference. However, if he chooses to pay premium for 5 years, the annual premium is RM113,044 which is more than the maximum insurance premium allowable under regulatory requirement. After rounding, for the above scenario, RM57,100 will be allocated into Protection Account and the remaining of RM55,944 will be allocated into Savings Account via A-Plus Saver.
