question:Example of how does the cap on the Accidental Death Benefits work?
answer: John, age 5 purchase a Basic Sum Assured of RM1.5 mil Amount payable upon: Death 100% of SA = RM1.5 mil Accidental Death 200% of SA = RM 3 mil. RM3 mil – RM1.5 mil = RM1.5mil, which is less than RM 5 mil Therefore, RM1.5 mil is payable under Accidental Death. Total Death Benefit amount = RM 1.5 mil (under Death Benefit) + RM 1.5 mil (under Accidental Death Benefit) = RM 3.0 mil Accidental Death 300% of SA = RM4.5 mil. (Public Conveyance) RM4.5 mil – RM1.5 mil = RM3mil, which is less than RM 5 mil Therefore, RM3 mil is payable under Accidental Death. Total Death Benefit amount = RM 1.5 mil (under Death Benefit) + RM 3 mil (under Accidental Death Benefit) = RM 4.5 mil Accidental Death 600% of SA = RM9 mil. (Natural Disaster) RM9 mil – RM1.5 mil = RM7.5mil, which is more than RM 5 mil Therefore, RM5 mil(capped) is payable under Accidental Death. Total Death Benefit amount = RM 1.5 mil (under Death Benefit) + RM 5 mil (under Accidental Death Benefit) = RM 6.5 mil Notes: 1) The above illustration is for new customer without existing Accidental Death benefit.
