Q:What is unique about A-Life Beyond Critical Care?
A:A-Life Beyond Critical Care is an innovative critical illness protection plan that covers critical illnesses from early to advanced stages. 
These are a few reasons why A-Life Beyond Critical Care is unique: 
• 180 critical illness conditions covered. This is comprised of 65 early critical illnesses, 40 intermediate critical illnesses, and 75 advanced critical illnesses. (At the time of launch, 5 August 2020, this product covers the highest number of critical illness conditions in the Malaysian insurance industry.) 
• 100% of basic sum assured will be payable upon diagnosis of an early, intermediate, or advanced critical illness. This enables flexibility to meet the needs of a wider variety of customers. 
• In addition to providing a lump sum benefit upon the diagnosis of a critical illness, we also encourage you to improve your health to reduce the risks of getting those critical illnesses to begin with. This is enabled with AIA Vitality which encourages healthy habits and also a health screening benefit of up to RM600 every 2 years (only for policies with basic sum assured of RM100,000 and above). • There is also a Yearly Cash Bonus of up to 20% of total premiums paid yearly (includes rider premiums and all loading premiums) depending on the Insured’s AIA Vitality Status. This rewards customers for their healthy habits and encourages them to keep up their good health. 
• Get a Guaranteed Maturity Benefit of up to 150% of total premiums paid (excluding any loading premiums) if the critical illness benefit has not been fully paid to celebrate a clean bill of health when your policy matures at the age of 80. With that, A-Life Beyond Critical Care is a critical illness plan that goes beyond the usual protection and focuses on prevention and early detection for a Healthier, Longer, Better Life.
