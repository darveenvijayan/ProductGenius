Whilst the Certificate is in force, and in the event that the modal Contribution due is not paid within the Grace Period, the ACS will be exercised.
Upon the exercise of ACS, the Contribution payment mode will automatically change to monthly mode (from annual / semi-annual / quarterly payment mode), and will remain as such even after Reinstatement until You have made a request to change the payment mode
Before this Takaful Certificate has acquired Surrender Value
(a)If the Contribution due is not paid within the Grace Period, we will have the right to use any available Account Value (from PIF then PSF) to pay:
(i)The unpaid monthly Takaful Contributions (excluding A-Plus Enhancer-i); and
(ii) The unpaid monthly attached Rider(s)’ Contributions.
(b)If the PIF is insufficient to cover for the contribution, we will have the right to use any available Account Value from PSF to pay:
(i)The unpaid monthly Takaful Contributions (A-Plus Enhancer-i); and
(ii)The unpaid monthly attached Rider(s)’ Contributions.
(c)The ACS will continue utilizing the Account Value (from PIF then PSF) until:
(i)The Takaful Certificate has acquired Surrender Value, or
(ii)the Account Value becomes insufficient or fully utilized.
After this Takaful Certificate has acquired Surrender Value
(a)If the Contribution due is not paid within the Grace Period, it will be paid from the Surrender Value (in PRF) that you may be entitled if this Certificate is surrendered or lapsed. The payment will be taken from the Surrender Value, according to the sequence of Contributions payment as follows:
(i)The unpaid monthly Takaful Contributions, and
(ii)The unpaid monthly attached Rider(s)’ Contribution.
Upon utilisation of the Surrender Value, the amount utilised will be considered as indebtedness to Us. Any future benefits or payout payable under this Certificate is subject to the deduction of the indebtedness, unless the same is paid by You.
(b)If the Surrender Value is insufficient to make the payment for the item mentioned above, the insufficient amount will be taken from the Account Value (from PIF then PSF) according to the sequence of Contributions payment as follows:
(i)The unpaid monthly Takaful Contributions, and
(ii)The unpaid monthly attached Rider(s)’ Contribution.
Under this clause, the Account Value is based on on the business day immediately on the date the Certificate becomes lapsed.
This will continue if the monthly Takaful Contributions and Rider(s)’ Contribution (if any) and any indebtedness remain unpaid at subsequent monthly due dates, provided there is sufficient amount of Surrender Value and/or Account Value (where applicable).
If the Account Value is insufficient to cover the monthly Takaful Contribution
- The Account Value will be refunded to the Participant and this Certificate and any attached Rider(s) shall subsequently lapse. Similarly, in the event the Account Value has been fully utilised, this Certificate and any attached Rider(s) shall subsequently lapse.
If the customer fails to pay the A-Plus Saver-i Contribution, NO ACS shall be triggered.
