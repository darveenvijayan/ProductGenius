section:A-Plus Saver
question:What is A-Plus Saver?
answer:A-Plus Saver refers to the portion of premium exceeding the maximum insurance premium allowed under the Bank Negara Malaysia requirement and/or regular top-up premium. This portion of premium will be allocated into Savings Account. A-Plus Saver may be attached automatically to the policy depending on premium payment term option and Sum Assured Multiple rules.

product name:A-Life Wealth Builder, ALWB
section:A-Plus Saver
question:Under what circumstances will A-Plus Saver be attached to A-Life Wealth Builder and why? 
answer:In order to comply with the Minimum Sum Assured Multiple (SAM) rule required by Bank Negara Malaysia, if the annual premium for A-Life Wealth Builder exceeds the maximum Protection premium allowed under the Bank Negara Malaysia requirement, the excess premium will be allocated into A-Plus Saver.
The Minimum Sum Assured Multiple (SAM) for age 18 to 25 years old is 55; 26 to 35 years old is 50; 36 to 45 years old is 35; 46 to 55 years old is 25; while for 56 and above is 15. 
For example, A male non-smoker aged 40, purchasing a A-Life Wealth Builder policy with sum assured
of RM1,000,000 and covers up to age 80. Maximum regular Protection premium allowable under the BNM guidelines is RM1,000,000/35 = RM28,571.43. If he chooses to pay premium throughout the coverage term, the annual premium is RM10,680 which is less than the maximum Protection premium allowable under
regulatory requirement and all the premiums will be allocated into Protection Account and A-Plus Saver is unnecessary. However, he still can choose to put some A-Plus Saver premium to increase his account value, depending on his own preference.
However, if he chooses to pay premium for 5 years, the annual premium is RM56,520 which is more than the maximum insurance premium allowable under regulatory requirement.
After rounding, for the above scenario, RM28,500 will be allocated into Protection Account and the remaining of RM28,020 will be allocated into Savings Account via A-Plus Saver.

For Accidental Death, the amount payable is 200% of SA = RM 12 mil, which is less than RM 25 mil (RM 12 mil - RM 6 mil). Therefore, RM 12 mil is payable. For Accidental Death of pulic conveyance, the amount payable is 300% of SA = RM 18 mil, which is less than RM 25 mil (RM 18 mil - RM 6 mil). Therefore, RM 18 mil is payable. For Accidental Death of natural disaster, the amount payable is 600% of SA = RM 36 mil, which is more than RM 25 mil (RM 36 mil - RM 6 mil). It capped of RM 25 mil plus iwht RM 6 mil.
